# Jetbrains Material Darker Orange Theme

Custom theme settings file for https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains

## Installation

Make sure you have installed the [Material Theme UI Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui) and restarted your IDE.

Go into Preferences > Appearance & Behavior -> Appearance and make sure "Material Darker" has been selected as the theme.

Go back to the same Appearance menu and look for the "Material Custom Theme" item, select this and then click on the dropdown with the three vertical dots to the right hand side. At the bottom of this dropdown select "Select XML file from disk" and select the xml file that you downloaded from this repository.

Once you have imported the file, select Apply on all dialogs.

## Updates

I plan to release some more updates to this colour scheme when I've got some more time so keep an eye out.
